# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:** 300
**Overlap:** 10

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->

When analyzed the average document length in "campus_life" corpora, the average length of the documents come around to be 300. Since the chunk size is set to be the average length of the document itself, the overlap sums to a small number for the chunks to give a little room only as the 300 chunk size is expected to retrieve the full,sensible document itself.

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

**Chunk 1** — source: admin_add_drop_deadline.txt#0 ` — produced by:chunker.py::split_documents`

```
On the add/drop deadline

You can add a course through the end of the second week. Dropping is a longer window — through the end of week six — but a drop after week two shows as a W on your transcript. Nothing anywhere on the registrar's site says this plainly, and students find out from each other.
```

**Chunk 2** — source:course_cs_210.txt#1 ` — produced by:chunker.py::split_documents`

```
0 hours a week outside class.

The one piece of advice: do the labs even though they're only 10% — the exams reuse the lab problems.
```

**Chunk 3** — source:course_stat_150.txt#0 ` — produced by:chunker.py::split_documents`

```
STAT 150 Applied Statistics

Transferred in last year, so take this with a grain of salt. Format is flipped: watch the recordings, class time is problem sets. Assessment: three equally weighted midterms, no final. No curve, but the lowest midterm is dropped.

Expect 5 to 6 hours a week outside class
```

**Chunk 4** — source: dining_the_ridgeway_cafe_followup.txt#1` — produced by:chunker.py::split_documents`

```
40 seats for a building of 900. Nobody tells you this at orientation.
```

**Chunk 5** — source:housing_morrow_house.txt#0 `— produced by:chunker.py::split_documents`

```
Morrow House — what it's actually like

Just finished a year in this building. Built 1954, partially renovated 2008. Rooms are singles and doubles, hall bathrooms.

The good: cheapest housing tier by about $900 a year, and the singles are real singles.

The bad: known damp problem on the ground floo
```

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:**
Is there a limit on individual booking of study group rooms ?
**Answer:**

```
(best distance 0.239, cutoff 0.6)

Yes, there is a limit of maximum two two-hour blocks per person per week.

Source: study_group_rooms.txt

Sources retrieved: course_econ_101.txt, dining_pellew_dining_hall_followup.txt, housing_fenwick_court.txt, housing_innisfree_hall.txt, study_group_rooms.txt
```

**My relevance cutoff: 0.58**

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

     Milestone 5. -->

**1.I used claude to generate the md version of the table above. Writing down manually felt time consuming and had to work efficiently. I fed in the context of how I ran the runs locally and it generated the md version of the table for me such that I had to change nothing.**

**2.I also used claude to see if the "chunk" and "overlap" in configs seemed reasonable enough for relevant retrieval. It asked me to set the overlap as 0 but I set that to the small number instead of setting it entirely 0.**

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion                              | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 2. Every answer names a source         | 5 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions  | 4 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 4.                                     |        |       |       |       |         |
| 5.                                     |        |       |       |       |         |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| #   | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
| --- | --------- | ------- | ------------- |
| 1   |           |         |               |
| 2   |           |         |               |
| 3   |           |         |               |
| 4   |           |         |               |
| 5   |           |         |               |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion                              | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
| -------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------- |
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 2. Every answer names a source         | 5 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions  | 4 of 5 |       |       |       |         |
| 4.                                     |        |       |       |       |         |
| 5.                                     |        |       |       |       |         |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
